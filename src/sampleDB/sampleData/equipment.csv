# Sample Data for the equipment assets
#
# Each line represents either a category of equipment or 
# any equipment asset.
#
# Format:
#
# A left justified line creates an equipment asset with no parent 
# (e.g. Rake or Shovel) or it creates 'Category' which is the parent 
# of all categories of equipment
#
# A line beginning with a single comma:
#   Creates an equipment category with its parent being 'Category' that it 
#   appears under.
#
# A line beginning with two commas:
#   Creates an equipment asset and sets its parent to the equipment 
#   category that it appears under (i.e. General is the parent of Tractor)
#
# Equipment categories have the format:
#   category name,category description.
#
# Equipment assets have the following comma delimited information:
#   name,manufacturer,model,description
